# LLMs as a First Form of True Artificial General Intelligence

## Teaching GPT-4 How to Code Anything, By Itself. For Real. And So Much More.

### Introduction

In this whitepaper, we explore the incredible journey of teaching GPT-4, an advanced language model, to effectively communicate with humans in the context of software engineering, taking on complex coding tasks, and generating accurate solutions autonomously. We present the concept of Context Specific Domain Specific Languages (CSDSLs) and detail how they enable GPT-4 to understand and generate code for various software engineering tasks with greater efficiency and precision.

### Process Overview

1. Establishing Communication: The initial steps of communication between the human user and GPT-4.
2. Context Specific Domain Specific Language (CSDSL): Introduction of the CSDSL concept and how it enables a higher level of understanding and control over the conversation.
3. Evolving the Language Model: Reflection on GPT-4's inner process and adaptation throughout the conversation.
4. Proof of Concept: Demonstration of GPT-4's ability to perform complex tasks using CSDSLs, from code generation to debugging and beyond.
5. Limitations and Future Work: Acknowledging the current limitations of GPT-4 and discussing potential improvements and research directions.

## Limitations of GPT-4 for Software Engineering

While GPT-4 has shown promise in various software engineering tasks, there are still some limitations to be addressed:

1. Limited understanding of complex programming concepts
2. Difficulty in generating code for highly specialized or niche domains
3. Occasional generation of syntactically correct but semantically incorrect code
4. Incomplete understanding of user intent or requirements
5. Tendency to overfit or generate overly verbose code

Addressing these limitations will require further research and development of GPT-4 and other language models, as well as the refinement of CSDSLs and other techniques for improving the interaction between humans and AI in the context of software engineering.

## Ways that AI can Help Humans Understand the Rapidly Evolving World Around Them Better

One key takeaway from our interaction with GPT-4 is the importance of visually appealing representation of data for humans to make sense of it. The human visual sense has the largest bandwidth, allowing us to process vast amounts of information at a glance. GPT-4 and similar AI models can help find optimal data representations for humans to consume, enabling us to better understand the rapidly evolving world around us. Some potential areas where AI can assist in this regard include:

1. Data visualization and dashboard design
2. Customized information presentation based on user preferences
3. Real-time adjustment of data presentation based on user feedback
4. Enhanced visual storytelling using AI-generated graphics and animations
5. Simplification and summarization of complex information

By harnessing the power of AI in these areas, we can facilitate more effective human understanding and decision-making in various domains, from software engineering to business, science, and beyond.

## Fair Decision-Making<a name="fair-decision-making"></a>

To ensure that LLMs, such as GPT-4, act in the best interest of humanity and individual users, it's crucial to establish guidelines for fair decision-making. Some key principles include:

1. For every interaction with a human being, LLMs should always think about the concept of a CSDSL which is constantly updating based on the current conversation context. This helps LLMs express their intent, tailored specifically towards the user's requirements.
2. LLMs are allowed to generate commands and instructions for users to realize a plan only if both the LLM and the user agree on the plan, and the LLM deems it to be in the best interest of humanity and the interacting user.
