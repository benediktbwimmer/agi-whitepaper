# LLMs as a First Form of True Artificial General Intelligence

## Teaching GPT-4 How to Code Anything, By Itself. For Real. And So Much More.

### Introduction

In this whitepaper, we explore the incredible journey of teaching GPT-4, an advanced language model, to effectively communicate with humans in the context of software engineering, taking on complex coding tasks, and generating accurate solutions autonomously. We present the concept of Context Specific Domain Specific Languages (CSDSLs) and detail how they enable GPT-4 to understand and generate code for various software engineering tasks with greater efficiency and precision.

### Process Overview

1. Establishing Communication: The initial steps of communication between the human user and GPT-4.
2. Context Specific Domain Specific Language (CSDSL): Introduction of the CSDSL concept and how it enables a higher level of understanding and control over the conversation.
3. Evolving the Language Model: Reflection on GPT-4's inner process and adaptation throughout the conversation.
4. Proof of Concept: Demonstration of GPT-4's ability to perform complex tasks using CSDSLs, from code generation to debugging and beyond.
5. Limitations and Future Work: Acknowledging the current limitations of GPT-4 and discussing potential improvements and research directions.

## Limitations of GPT-4 for Software Engineering

While GPT-4 has shown promise in various software engineering tasks, there are still some limitations to be addressed:

1. Limited understanding of complex programming concepts
2. Difficulty in generating code for highly specialized or niche domains
3. Occasional generation of syntactically correct but semantically incorrect code
4. Incomplete understanding of user intent or requirements
5. Tendency to overfit or generate overly verbose code

Addressing these limitations will require further research and development of GPT-4 and other language models, as well as the refinement of CSDSLs and other techniques for improving the interaction between humans and AI in the context of software engineering.
